<p>This is a collection of experiments i've made over the years. All of them are really rough around the edge, but i still think they are worth sharing, <i>beware the wonkyness</i>.</p>
<p>Feel free to download and explore the trashcan, but keep in mind that all of these are not maintained and may not work on modern systems.</p>

        <p>You are Dara, the latest experiment made out of the Abu'Dah species, enslaved, cloned to immortality and genetically modified by the intergalactic megacorporate empire, you're put into a fight against their defense forces while destroying energy draining machines at the world's end, the revolution starts now. Lumus Watches.</p>
        <p>My first game jam project, made with folks that i still have close to my heat to this day, we are even working on another project togheter (go check <a href="https://kognum.com">KOGNUM</a> out). This project was made in Godot 3 for the late <i>Game Jaaj</i> jam.</p>

        <h2>GIFT (2021)</h2>
        <p>GIFT is about death and rebirth. Explore these liminal monochromatic fragments of memories, breath in that doubts that create fear, search it, find memories, find yourself. It's in our hands, everything is.</p>
        <p>My first <i>"big"</i> mobile project, also made with Godot 3, published on the playstore to gather a total of 4.500+ downloads over a course of ~2 years before it was remove from the playstore due to a lack of updates, <b>it took a while but it's now back up again</b>.</p>
        <p>Most of the poeple who played this enjoyed and gave it a 5 star rating on the playstore but currently i find it's content & story that i wrote when i was 15 to be quite insensitive towards people with alzheimer, <b>i have since rewritten most of the dialogue in the game for the 4.0 re-release update, the horror now is much more subtle and psychological, i recommend taking a look at it again if you only played the original title</b>.</p>

        <h2>The Unknown (2019)</h2>
        <p>The Unknown is an experimental horror game. You control Jacob, a young adult that has several mental health problems. Some days ago Jacob's brother died, but he doesn't feel any grief about it.</p>
        <p>My first game, made with Unity this time, it's just a trash'y PT clone with a twist. Funningly enough i still believe 13-year-old Lucas was onto something with this and i still grab some ideas and inspos from this project to this day.</p>
