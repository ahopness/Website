<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
<p>I am <b>Lucas Ã‚ngelo</b> - but i also go by the handle <i>ahopness</i> online - a computer engeneering student at the <a href="https://www.uerj.br">Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ)</a>. Ever since i was a kid i liked to use computers and code as means to express myself, <i>bounded by 0s and 1s the problems that life gives us seem simpler to solve</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>My interests range from graphics and gameplay to mobile and backend programming. I have experiences developing and publishing applications to mobile and desktop via digital storefronts using various tech stacks, from <b>game development</b> ones (like Unity, Monogame, but mainly Godot) to <b>Flutter</b>, <b>Flask</b> and <b>ASP.NET Core</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>I also enjoy making art on my free time, inspired by existentialist literature and experimental films and games, most of my works have this dream'y/personal/sensorial feel to them. At the moment I'm focussed on finishing some personal game dev projects of mine, you can hear more about it <a href="/gcg-1/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You might also know me from the <a href="https://github.com/ahopness/GodotRetro">Godot Retro</a> shader pack i made for the Godot game engine, it currently has 500+ stars on github and is frequently used by it's community to assist the making of retro/lo-fi style games in the engine.</p>
